        <h1>AHCM</h1>
        <h2>Legal Threat</h2>
        <p>
            If a caller threatens to sue us, call the police on us, report us to the insurance commission etc. we must send an email to Internalcomplaints@ahcminc.com
            <br>
            <br>Please make sure to follow the correct legal threat template.
            <br>On the subject line:
            <br>
            <br>In the section for (Your Department) please type "MS" or "Member Services" DO NOT TYPE "CSR".		In "Type of legal threat:" Please describe the threat they made not just that it was a "legal threat".								
            <br>
            <br>moving forward we need all internal complaints when being submitted to include the (STATE) - (member id#) on the subject line for example this member resides in California so just need to put (department / CA / ID# and No Action/Action Needed) that is the only update on the template.
        </p>
        <h3>Action needed VS Action not needed:</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>ACTION NEEDED: </strong>There was no resolution at the end of the call, the member requires a call back to try to resolve the complaint and more investigation on the account is required.
            <br><strong>NO ACTION NEEDED: </strong>Members' complaint was resolved, the member does not need to be called, and no further action needs to be made on the account.
            <br>
