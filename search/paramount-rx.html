        <p>
            Please make sure when we are transferring to Paramount RX we are only transferring if the member wants to verify the discount for a certain medication. Please do not transfer to discuss prescription benefits. Paramount will not take the call if member is asking for the benefits. Please explain to the member they have a discount prescription plan and if they will like to see the exact discount for a certain prescription then we transfer. If an agent denies the call after reassuring them the call is to review discounts, please let me know.

            It was nice speaking with you today. As I indicated on the phone, I was able to find my current compliance contact with AHCM; it is Alisha Burks, who I am copying on this email. As we discussed, Paramount Rx needs current marketing materials associated with the new AHCM line of business call Jericho Shares. Most importantly, we need a membership card image to review for legal language compliance and customer service phone numbers to provide to members who may call in to our help desk in the case we are unable to assist with their question. Lastly, please provide the following link to your marketers and CSR team for use in pricing medications through the Paramount Rx discount prescription program. Again, as we discussed, the public facing price tool on our corporate website does NOT reflect the contracted rates we have in place with AHCM. Please use this pricing tool moving forward.
