                A mammogram is a high-definition, very low dose X-ray of the breast to detect breast cancer or other breast diseases, and can find early-stage lesions.
            </li>
            <li>
                Meanwhile, a breast ultrasound scan is a scanning technique that uses ultrasound waves. It is recommended especially for women under 35 years of age as an initial diagnostic test and sometimes for women over that age in addition to mammography. After the age of 35, mammograms are recommended, since they are more accurate for detecting breast cancer, as microcalcifications can be observed, which may be the first signs of the disease. It should be remembered that the risk of developing breast cancer increases with age.

                If a provider or member calls to verify features for a mammogram, please ask the following question… “Is this service for Wellness or Diagnostic”?
                <ul>
                    <li>Wellness – Annual screening, just a checkup of the breast to confirm the colon is healthy and not abnormal, this is usually done periodically.</li>
                    <li>Diagnostic - helps diagnose breast abnormalities, such as a lump or breast pain. It can also be used to follow up on suspicious findings from a screening mammogram.</li>
                </ul>
