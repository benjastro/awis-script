        <h2>Escheated Checks</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>When a check expires without having been claimed, it is an escheated check. Some examples of escheated checks include payroll and traveler's checks.</li>
            <li>If you send a check to a vendor, employee, or customer, there's a chance they might not receive or remember it. As a result, they do not cash the check. The check then becomes escheated and the state gets the funds.</li>
            <li>The payee who did not cash their check before it became escheated can apply to their state to claim it.</li>
        </ul>
