        <h2>ID Card - Haven't receive ID Card - Outside 30 days</h2>
        <p>
            I will send the request to mail your ID card and it should arrive within 10-14 business days.
            <br><br>Let me verify the correct mailing address so that we can be sure that you can receive this.
            <br><br>(Please verify the correct address in file and to ask if there's any unit or apartment in there.)
            <br><br>In the meantime, I will send you a temporary ID card thru your email.
            <br><br>Let me just confirm if this is your active email _________________________. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Anything else I can help you with?
            <br><br>(Discuss a brief summary of the call) Thank you for calling Member Services. Have a blessed day!
