    <h1>AHCM</h1>
    <h2>Cancellation - Active - Active - Within 30 days</h2>
    <h4>With refund request or future active</h4>
    <p>
        I've notated your request to cancel your account with refund.

        <br><br> Bear one moment while we connect you to your agency/Cancellation Dept to further assist you.

        <br><br> I will stay on the line and provide the agent with the details on your request.

        <br><br> Please hold while I get an agent on the line.
    </p>
    <p class="note">Note: Please check the agency transfer list to determine if this needs to be transfer to the agency or account services.</p>
