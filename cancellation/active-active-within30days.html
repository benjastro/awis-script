        <h2>Cancellation - Active - Active - Within 30 days</h2>
        <p>
            “May I have the reason why you are cancelling your account?”
            <br><strong>Regardless of the reason, please attempt to save:  Sample responses, chose one that fits the objection.</strong> 
            <br>
            <br>&emsp;⦁ <u>Other coverage, have coverage thru employer</u>
            <br>&emsp;&emsp;⦁	I can understand that but would you like to reconsider and keep this plan as your secondary or back up plan?
            <br>&emsp;&emsp;⦁	I see you point but would you like to speak with your enrolling agency first to find other plans that would fit within your budget before deciding to cancel? In this way you can be assured that you are not losing coverage.
            <br>
            <br>&emsp;⦁ <u>Doesn't Cover Specific Needs</u> 
            <br>&emsp;&emsp;⦁	I see where you are coming from but if I may suggest for you to review the plan benefits first by logging in to your portal? 
            <br>
            <br>&emsp;<strong>⦁	(FOR SLP ACCOUNTS)</strong> 
            <br>&emsp;&emsp;⦁	I see what you're saying but have you tried using your Wellific App that collect, manage and share personal health information to help you manage your daily health necessities. This app comes with your plan free of charge.
            <br>
            <br>&emsp;⦁	Financial Reasons, can't afford
            <br>&emsp;&emsp;⦁	I see you point but would you like to speak with your enrolling agency first to find other plans that would fit within your budget before deciding to cancel? In this way you can be assured that you are not losing coverage.
            <br>
            <br>&emsp;⦁	Misrepresented, did not authorize, caller claims that they were lied to, they were scammed or similar scenarios - NEVER agree or confirm with them.  
            <br>&emsp;&emsp;⦁	I can see where you are coming from but if I may suggest for you to review the plan benefit first. (Mention some of the benefits of the plan like: MD LIVE, current program features, options to upgrade or downgrade policy, etc.)
            <br>&emsp;&emsp;⦁	I understand where you are coming from however, we are a third-party admin service. We are not affiliated with the agency that enrolled you.
