        <p>
            "Do you have any specific service or services in mind so I can direcltly search for it?
            <br>
            <br>(Provide the information requested) Is there anything else I can help you with?
            <br>
            <br>If no:
            <br>
            <br>(Provide a brief summary of what was discussed) Thank you for calling Member Services, have a blessed day!
        </p>
        <p class="note">
            Reminders: 
            <br>*If a provider gives you a CPT Code to verify if the service is covered, please state:
            <br>
            <br>"We don't interpret CPT codes but if you can specify what the service is, I can check if the benefits is supported under the member's plan."
            <br>
            <br>The reason we don't interpret CPT codes is because we are NOT medically trained on medical terminology and medical codes. Don't put yourself in a compromising position trying to interpret CPT codes. Just ask the caller to once again specify what the service is for. 
            <br>
            <br>*When a provider calls in regarding a specific benefit that is not part of the members core plan we still want to advise of the additional benefits the member might have. This will eliminate the chances of a possible escalation call.												
            <br>For example:								
            <br>Provider calls in regarding radiology benefits. (They do not have radiology benefits on their medical plan but they do have an add on that has discounts for radiology.)								
            <br>We want to advise provider:  "They do not have benefits for radiology under their medical plan, however they do have a discount plan that includes radiology. The member can call us directly for us to provide the information of where they need to call/go."	
            <br>                               
            <br>*Provider calls in for pcp visit, (member has telemedicine).								
            <br>We want to advise provider: "They do not have benefits for an in person pcp visit but they do have telemedicine. This is through a specific company and the member can call us to request additional information."								
            <br>As always, if a member does not have a specific benefit at all on the account, we want to mention in-network repricing. (If it applies.)
            <br>
            <br>*Remember to advise the provider of any waiting period and pre-existing clause usually mentioned on the bottom part of the brochure.
