            Please check the Updated Agency Transfer List first before transferring the call to determine whether we transfer the call to Account Services or the Agency. 
            <br>
            <br>If the agency is listed on the "Agencies that Get All Calls" we can go ahead and transfer them to the provided telephone number. 
            <br>
            <br>"Before I transfer the call, is there anything else I can help you with?
            <br>
            <br>If no: 
            <br>
            <br>"Please stay on the line while I transfer you.. Please hold.."
            <br>
            <br>If the agency is listed on the "DO NOT Transfer List", please transfer the call to Account Services. 866-886-4808 / 866-205-6009. 
            <br>Please note that the number is for internal use only and we don't provide them to the caller. 
            <br>
            <br>"To better assist you, I will be transferring the call to ____________, to help you find a coverage that would suit your needs / fit your budget.

            Reminders:
            <br>*We should always attempt a warm transfer!								
            <br>&emsp;This allows us to share information directly with the representative who answers.							
            <br>&emsp;This also allows us to verify that there isn't an issue with the call connecting.							
            <br>&emsp;Include the name of the representative in your notes!
            <br>
            <br>*When a warm transfer cannot be completed within 2 minutes, inform the caller that they will be transferred to the queue, then complete the transfer.
            <br>&emsp;   Certain types of cold transfers will require an email follow up (billing & agency/retention email templates/guides have been provided for these cases).
            <br>&emsp;    CSRs should have their notes completed when transferring so that the next representative can use them to assist the caller.
            <br>&emsp;    Include the transfer details in your notes (Reason for transfer, left caller in Queue due to no connection in 2 minutes)!
